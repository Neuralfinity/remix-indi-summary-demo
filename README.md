# Demo App to showcase Magic-Summary inside of Remix (with Indi-Stack)

## TLDR
At [Neuralinity](https://www.neuralfinity.com/) we have built the Magic-Summary API to summarise texts with the help of our in-house trained large language model.

You asked for more examples of how it can be used in a production web app. Since we've been enjoying [Remix](https://remix.run/) a lot recently, we decided build a demo app with the Remix [Indi stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack), so you can get a feel for daily work with out API. 

If you want to see more details, go watch [this video](https://youtube.com/). 

## Who is this for? 
Anyone interested in building a web app with Magic-Summary, especially if you want to use Remix. The same ideas apply to ways to build a web app,too.
