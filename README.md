# Demo App to showcase Magic-Summary inside of Remix (with Indi-Stack)
A web app to demonstrate Magic-Summary with Remix Indi Stack

## TLDR
At [Neuralinity](https://www.neuralfinity.com/) we have built the Magic-Summary API to summarise texts with the help of our in-house trained large language model.

You asked for more examples of how it can be used in a production web app. Since we've been enjoying [Remix](https://remix.run/) a lot recently, we decided build a demo app with the Remix [Indi stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack), so you can get a feel for daily work with out API. 

If you want to see more details, go watch [this video](https://youtube.com/). 

## Who is this for? 
1. Anyone interested in building a web app with Magic-Summary, especially if you want to use Remix. The same ideas apply to ways to build a web app,too.
2. Those who want a quick Magic-Summary based app, but don't want to spend the time building it themselves

We added an MIT licence, so you can use this as a starter if you like (or any other purpose).

## How to recreate this
1. Create a Remix App through the CLI and choose "Indi Stack" and Typescript
2. Register on the [Neuralfinity Website](https://www.neuralfinity.com/waitlist/) and get your own API key (Free Tier available)
3. Install graphql-request 
4. Integrate the API
